description: An attempt to explain how I think about the value prop of DevRel

## Preface

Yeah so this is my attempt at doing a bit more writing and trying to get some thoughts out of my head and out into the world to share.
I would really like to see devrel as an industry start to try to work on standardizing what it is and what it is and what it isn't. And what career paths look like for the role.

## DevRel is 3 functions

I think in practice DevRel should sit in 3 different categories.

- Content
- Community
- Product

I think there are easy ways to bucket the work that you will be doing in devrel into one of these 3 buckets. If what you're doing doesn't fall into these, I'm not saying that _someone_ be doing it, just that you should be giving it extra thought if _you_ are the person best equipped to deal with the problem. A common problem I see among the devrel industry is a lack of direction on what it is they're supposed to be doing.

Day-to-day it may look like things are being done, but when you look at your work over a several month period and can't see any clear patterns, you should be looking very critically at what you're supposed to do in your organization.

I'll say this once and only once; as someone working in devrel you have the best idea of what you **should** be doing. I see often people wondering what value they bring to the organization. The lack of direction is evident. And once you clearly define what you should be doing you will have a new-found sense of value.

Anyways, that's enough talk about random stuff around lack of direction as an profession-wide issue. I'm here to write thoughts about the 3 different functions that I see devrel being useful in.

## Content

Of course! This is what DevRel is right? Its a bunch of devs that instead of writing production code, sit around, make blog posts, record videos, talk highly of themselves in podcast episodes, and then fly around the continent to spread the news about how great their company is. I kid, but only partially. Content is really the minimum of a devrel function. Content, whether it be industry hot takes, annual reviews, or educational tutorials, will be a regular part of your workload.

I think this content bit is what gets DevRel roped into marketing by certain orgs. And I'm of the opinion this is where several devrel functions begin and end. Content made for developers. This is useful, but for the salaries that are usually paid out for developer advocates, I would argue that you're overpaying for what you're buying. You could contract out industry-respected freelancers to write about whatever topics. They come out to be cheaper, and usually bring some audience with them.

I think a devrel function needs to come up with an overarching content strategy that ties in multiple different media types, and interweaves them all into a cogent plan. Creating a newsletter that then distributes all of your blogposts, videos, and relevant community highlights. These all things that you are problably doing, and have excellent context on how to relate them all together for an easily digestable package to wrap up and send to everyone.

This is an example of doing something in DevRel that would otherwise take multiple organizations to execute on. You would need an engineer that wrote a technical-blog post to coordinate with a marketing person for distribution. By sitting between multiple organizations, you are providing a unique value-add. Again, this ties back to knowing what **you** should be doing. Devrel can be pulled in many directions at once, and knowing what you can delegate to different orgs, and where you need to step in is key to success.

## Community

Oh jeez this is like **the** thing being talked about not just in web3 specifically, but devrel as a whole. Not for no reason, there is certainly an incredibly important value-add here. Doubly so in web3 given so many dApps are opensource. You can fork pretty much anything, put a small twist on it, and release it to your benefit. Communities create a moat for these products. This is true not just for web3, but for pretty much any product.

There's great work being done around trying to come up with how to build tech communities, and trying to extract insights from the work put into growing them. You can see post like [swyx's community building blogpost](linktothathere) on how you do this, and why you should want to. When it comes to measuring community I'm a big fan of the orbit model, although I think you need to not take it too literally. Pretty much anything you see being done at a successfull company can be emulated, but needs to be tweaked to fit the context of your particular product if you want to see true success.

I think this is one reason DevRel ends up being so open/transparent about how they measure themselves, or what their companies strategy is towards a particular idea. Your OKRs, or KPIs, or whatever 3 letter acronym you decide to measure success by isn't a competitive advantage without the culture and context of your company behind it. Community is a stark example. If your company sends you into your direct competitors discord and you try to emulate it, you will fail miserably. There are several reasons for this, but a community is quite similar to a company in the sense that what gave you your first 10x, is not going to be what gets you your 2nd 10x. While I say 10x, it really isn't the **number** that needs to be going up, and this is why measuring community is so historically difficult.

Building a community from 0 is also a great deal about doing things that don't scale. There's something to be said for a member just hanging out always sharing things, creating conversations, and just generally being useful. Much in the way leadership functions in larger companies are about routing resources to the appropriate areas, community leaders are the hubs for community members.

This is another situation where you are able to tie multiple pillars of DevRel together for maximum effect. Content is an excellent way to bootstrap your community in the beginning. Not only does it give you something to talk about, but if you're listening closely to what your community is talking about, they will inform you of what content you should be making. DevRel is all about the flywheels.

## Product

This is one I hear often when reading about devrel, but not when speaking with people who are working in the space. I think more often than not, organizations haven't properly defined what devrel should be doing, and where they are stakeholders.

There are some companies that put devrel under the engineering org, and this is an attempt to ensure they "get a seat at the table." That isn't a dig at all to companies that do this by the way; there's no straightforward or "correct" answer to this problem. Just another situation where not knowing what the organization is supposed to be doing causes painpoints. To achieve maximum impact I think DevRel needs to be involved with how the product is being built.

> As a seperate note, this is speaking to specifically devtools companies. I'm currently of the opinion if you are not selling a service/product to developers, that a DevRel functions is entirely unnecessary, but that's a post for another time.

More often than not, developer advocacy ends up being entirely outbound. They spent all of their time doing external facing work. They work on docs, they write content, and engage in the community. When they try to surface feedback they find themselves locked out of the important conversations, and don't have a proper voice within the company.

DevRel provides incredible insight into what patterns users are following. For how much PMs are talked about as needing to be "in the minds of the user", there are surprinsgly few companies I hear about taking full advantage of this capacity of DevRel. Again I'm going to talk about flywheels here, as if you're properly integrated with your community, you will have great insight into how your users are behaving, and how you can improve their experience internally.

## Wrapping up

An insight that I gained while writing this that I would like to share with you reader, is that you will usually see DevRel level up in this order. The better the team, the more likely it is they're able to source user insights and feed them into the product. While lesser teams will find themselves spinning their wheels on content.

Overall I think DevRel at many companies find themselves pigeon-holed into only doing 1 thing, or so spread-out they struggle to articulate where they are actually providing value to the business. More needs to be done in the space for DevRel as a profession to continue to grow and thrive. Companies clearly see value in it, even if historically there haven't been amazing insights into how the org adds to the bottom line. Be the change you want to see in the world anon.

As a footnote this is really not meant for you reader. I hope you gained something from it, but if you didn't, just know it wasn't written for you, it was written for future me.
